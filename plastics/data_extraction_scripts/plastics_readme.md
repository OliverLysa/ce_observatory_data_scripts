# Plastics overview

Plastics are a ubiquitous material in modern-day UK.

Answering the questions vs. how we answer the questions - RAP.

## Policy context {.scrollable}

### Policy instruments

-   **Legally binding target**: Reduction in per-capita waste excluding major minerals (England)

-   **Commitment:** Eliminate avoidable plastic waste by 2042 (England), incl. extra-household

    -   **Potential commitment**: End plastic pollution by 2040 (UK)

-   **Packaging EPR:** Adjustments to existing system incl. fee modulation

### Evidence needed for

-   **Prioritisation:** Which materials and products are critical or offer 'easy wins'

-   **Assessing potential impacts**: Potential impacts of changes in system e.g. pEPR extended to other materials for waste, emissions & economy

-   **Policy design:** identifying exemptions for difficult to substitute end-uses e.g., medical, avoiding perverse incentives

## Policy [questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vv6DBDA-n5J11wsVYoAhPlzRqY9dC-sb8YfdUe5pQXE/edit "Google docs summary"), information requirements (baseline/ ex post)

What questions are we trying to answer, measure, monitorÂ  and hence what indicators/metrics to track.

### *Scope and level of detail*

#### Materials

-   Plastics:

    -   in particular PVC, PS (EPS & HIPS) PP, PET

-   Other materials relevant to scope of (potential) regulation e.g. high wet strength paper/card, glass

#### Geographical

-   UK-wide

-   Sub-UK breakdown at national level, including at least England

-   By Local Authority for some variables of interest

### *By value chain stage*

#### Material formulation \>\> product distribution

-   Mass of flows for materials & products of interest across inflow stages
    -   Domestic production and trade: Quantities, including precursor materials, base plastics e.g. pellets/sheet, intermediate products, final products.
    -   Split by primary vs secondary flows
-   Efficiency of associated manufacturing/production processes
-   Size of the current market in economic terms
-   How flows are anticipated to change into the future

#### Product usage

-   End uses for materials/products in scope
    -   Both sector e.g. construction; and
    -   applications e.g. bottles, pots/tubs/trays
-   Location of use/consumption (stocks)

#### Post-use

-   Mass and composition[^plastics_readme-1] of materials/products across post-use value chain routes and final fates, including:
    -   *Reuse-repurposing* (higher value retention activities)
    -   *Recycling*:
        -   by treatment type: mechanical/chemical, close-loop/open-loop.
        -   Number of cycles through the recycling system
    -   *Incineration and landfill*
    -   *Waste exported (and imported)*
    -   *Littering and other environmental leakage*: mass, types and location
-   Efficiency of the recycling process
    -   Both an encompassing rejection-rate (including contamination) and recycling process efficiency
-   Costs by treatment route, environmental impact, current infrastructure and potential of near-market technologies
-   Relevant SIC codes to the post-use value chain in plastics and size of domestic activity

## Policy questions, information requirements (ex ante assessment)

### Impacts of changes in pEPR

-   Continued consumption under a BAU

-   What might be the potential impacts of changes in the scope or fee level under pEPR across different materials?

    -   Materials including:

        -   all PVC packaging incl. PVC components

        -   all PS packaging

        -   Plastic film excl. PE

        -   Multi-polymer packaging

        -   High wet strength paper and card

    -   Informed by a pre- and post-assessment of material flow impacts of packaging tax

### Policy design: how to avoid perverse outcomes of instruments

-   How to avoid perverse outcomes from fee modulation? e.g. If modulating too heavily based on packaging's recyclability, unintentionally promoting recyclability over reduction

### Impacts on UK PLC

-   How businesses could be affected by changes to the system based on where particular UK interest might be

### Identified gaps

-   Non-municipal packaging
-   Non-packaging plastics
    -   Including bulky waste/long life plastics
-   More granular detail - beyond level 1 granularity at disposal
-   Material import/export data

# Approach to answering the questions

## Classifications across the dimensions that data is mapped to

1.  Material
2.  Product
3.  Region
4.  Value chain stage

## **Identification of data inputs**

Source identification script

Inventorying data schema for classifying the datasets and the information they provide

## Extraction scripts

RAP as a principle underpinning the approach

Compliance costs as a monitored variable.

More granular data allows for more detailed assessment of trends. Less time-lag

## Policies

-   DRS - contingencies include return-infrastructure (issues in California)

-   Level of demand for rPET
