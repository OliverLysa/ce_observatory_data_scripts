/**
 * Initialize a `ModelRunner` that runs the model asynchronously in a worker
 * (a Web Worker when running in a browser environment, or a worker thread
 * when running in a Node.js environment).
 *
 * In your app project, define a JavaScript file, called `worker.js` for example,
 * that initializes the generated model in the context of a worker thread:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { exposeModelWorker } from '@sdeverywhere/runtime-async/worker'
 * import loadGeneratedModel from './sde-prep/generated-model.js'
 *
 * exposeModelWorker(loadGeneratedModel)
 * ```
 *
 * Then, in your web app, call the `spawnAsyncModelRunner` function, which
 * will spawn the worker thread and initialize the `ModelRunner` that communicates
 * with the worker:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { spawnAsyncModelRunner } from '@sdeverywhere/runtime-async/runner'
 *
 * async function initApp() {
 *   // ...
 *   const runner = await spawnAsyncModelRunner({ path: './worker.js' })
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param workerSpec Either a `path` to the worker JavaScript file, or the `source`
 * containing the full JavaScript source of the worker.
