Mapping of model to populate

## Indicator and model definition

What questions are we trying to answer, measure, monitor  and hence what indicators/metrics  and availablse data source

**Demand**

National/aggregate Current and future demand for REE magnets (split by use eg EV, wind, HDD etc )

Alternative technologies and price/performance differential potentially by quality and quantitiy of sources (e.g. recycled vs. virgin)

**BoM Product**

The BoM for individual magnet + price for individual materials

Virgin v secondary material

Environmental impact, carbon footprint at each stage and total

Prices and the value add at each step incl. trasportantion/distribution

Total quantity of BoMs + product by weight/value by time

Total stocks

Product/material circularity index

USE

§  Economic performance over installed base in use

§  Economic performance over throughput

§  Economic usage time vs. technological usage time

**Supply**

Sources/origins/suppliers  of BoM and the finished magnet up to UK import

Supply chain risk

Physical efficiency

**Economic**

Money value of REE magnet output (UK) by stage

Import/export at different levels of product aggregation

Contribution to employment by stage

ROI/ROCE and NPV on re-use options

Economic contribution to vehicle/firm/sector

**Reverse Flow(s)**

Overall resource productivity

Material and product lifespan (technical v actual)

Collection rate/losses

CE re-use ( reclaim, reman)

Recycle Rate (tonnage, number)

Value recovery actual and potential

All the above by Building block intervention and whole system shift

### Dataset metadata database

Schema for classifying the datasets - helps filter between them. Also info on licence etc. What information do we want about each source?
