# One difficulty with using production statistics, is that firms report on behalf of their primary activity
# The above codes therefore capture only values for firms for which repair is primary activity e..g omitting in-house repair activities of a retailer
# Therefore consumption statistics e.g. family spending surveys may offer a wider and more accurate picture
