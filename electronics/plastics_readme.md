#### [000_classification_matching.R](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/electronics/000_classification_matching.R)

The observatory dashboard presents product-level data on electronics using two classifications:

1.  A 54 category '[UNU-KEY'](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/classifications/classifications/UNU.xlsx) classification (Wang et al., 2012; [Forti, Baldé and Kuehr, 2018](https://collections.unu.edu/eserv/UNU:6477/RZ_EWaste_Guidelines_LoRes.pdf)) - the objective of which is to group products by 'similar function, comparable material composition (in terms of hazardous substances and valuable materials) and related end-of-life attributes...in addition to...a homogeneous average weight and life-time distribution' ([Baldé *et al.* 2015](https://i.unu.edu/media/ias.unu.edu-en/project/2238/E-waste-Guidelines_Partnership_2015.pdf)); and
2.  A 14 category classification used by public authorities in the UK to report EEE/WEEE-related data against.

Material classification

Activity classification

##### Inputs

-   UNU-HS6 correspondence table ([Baldé *et al.* 2015](https://i.unu.edu/media/ias.unu.edu-en/project/2238/E-waste-Guidelines_Partnership_2015.pdf))
-   CN8 codes
-   Prodcom codes
-   UKU14-UNU54 interactive mapping tool ([Stowell, Yumashev et al. 2019)](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/wot-insights-into-the-flows-and-fates-of-ewaste-in-the-uk(3465c4c6-6e46-4ec5-aa3a-fe13da51661d).html)

##### Workflow

The [script](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/classification_matching/UNU_classification_matching.R) imports stand-alone classifications and a correspondence table published in the literature and makes an expanded correlation table to help move between the data sources drawn on. It takes the following steps:

1.  Imports UNU_HS6 correspondence table ([Baldé *et al.* 2015](https://i.unu.edu/media/ias.unu.edu-en/project/2238/E-waste-Guidelines_Partnership_2015.pdf))
2.  Joins UNU_HS6 to CN8 to create a [correspondence table](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/classifications/concordance_tables/UNU_2_CN8_2_PRODCOM_SIC.csv) for extracting UK trade data

<details>

<summary>More info: HS/CN classification</summary>

The 6 digit Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) developed by the World Customs Organisation forms the basis of the 8 digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) and is relatively consistent with nomenclature systems for describing domestic production drawn on in the UK (Prodcom).

</details>

3.  Joins to the UK prodcom classification for extracting domestic production data

<details>

<summary>More info: Prodcom classification</summary>

Prodcom headings used in statistics on UK manufacturing production draw on up to eight-digit numerical codes, the first six of which align with the Classification of Products by Activity (CPA) and with two additional digits for further detail. The CPA coding frame for describing products (goods and services) extends the SIC classification by two further digits in alignment with the UN Central Product Classification (CPC).

</details>

4.  Joins to the SIC 2 and 4-digit level to create sector-level aggregates and link to GVA and emissions data to create productivity and intensity ratios

<details>

<summary>More info: SIC classification</summary>

The UK National Accounts (UKNA) describe national production, income, consumption, accumulation and wealth, and are the basis from which key national-level aggregates and indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) are derived. The UK accounts are compiled by the UK ONS largely in accordance with the System of National Accounts (SNA), an internationally agreed standard set of recommendations introduced in the 1950s on how to compile national accounts covering agreed concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules. The SNA broadly separates economic actors into producing units (mainly corporations, nonprofit institutions and government units) and consuming units (mainly households). On the production side and as part of the UKNA, industries are classified into branches of homogeneous institutional units producing goods and services described under a given heading of a product classification (Lequiller and Blades, 2014). The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007, the first version of which was introduced in 1948 and which has since been revised several times, is a hierarchical 5 digit framework used in the UKNA to classify businesses by the type of economic activity they engage in.

Companies are self-assigned to at least one (and up to four) of a condensed list of SIC codes (\~730) when registering with the UK Companies House and again, but to a single code associated with their highest valueadded activity (principal activity), for most statistical returns (Jacobs and O'Neill, 2003). The UK SIC (2007) is based on the 4 digit International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) developed by the UN (ONS, 2009) while mirroring the NACE Rev. 2 classification developed by Eurostat and adding a further digit of detail where deemed useful. Overall, the UK SIC (2007) consists of 21 sections, 88 divisions, 272 groups, 615 classes and 191 subclasses, with a revision to the current structure planned in 2023.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [001_international_trade.R](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/electronics/001_international_trade.R)

Script extracts international trade data from the UKTradeInfo API using the 'uktrade' R package/wrapper.

##### Inputs

-   CN8 trade codes derived from 000_classification_matching.R script
-   Extractor function in functions script

##### Workflow

1.  Isolates list of CN8 codes from classification database for codes of interest
2.  Uses a for loop to iterate through the trade terms and extract trade data using the 'uktrade' extractor function/wrapper to the UKTradeInfo API and print results to a single dataframe (this can take some time to run)
3.  Sums results grouped by year, flow type, country of source/destination, trade code as well as by year, flow type and trade code (where country detail is not required)
4.  Projections
5.  Exports data to CSV format

##### Outputs

-   CSV of trade data (imports and exports) by CN8 code
-   CSV of trade data by UNU-Key, including broken-down by country
-   CSV of trade data by UNU-Key, without country breakdown

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [002_domestic_production.R](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/electronics/002_domestic_production.R)

Script extracts UK domestic production data from the annual ONS publication. Estimation of missing values through interpolation and outlier replacement is undertaken in script 003.

##### Inputs

-   [ONS Prodcom data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/manufacturingandproductionindustry/bulletins/ukmanufacturerssalesbyproductprodcom/2021results) (2008-20) and [2021 onwards](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/manufacturingandproductionindustry/datasets/ukmanufacturerssalesbyproductprodcom). Prodcom currently collates data for 232 industries at the 4 digit code level and covers SIC Divisions 8-33. 'Items within PRODCOM can be divided into three main categories (raw materials, industries' intermediate consumption and final consumer products)' ([Barrett *et al.* 2004](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245912879_Development_of_Physical_Accounts_for_the_UK_and_Evaluating_Policy_Scenarios)).
-   Prodcom codes for the electronics sector derived from 000_classification_matching.R

##### Workflow

1.  Imports the UK ONS Prodcom datasets published by the ONS as multi-page spreadsheets, binds all sheets to create a single table, binds the 2008-2020 and 2021 data and exports full dataset for use across product categories as well as filtering to those specific to electronis
2.  As Prodcom includes **suppressed values** to protect confidentiality ([ONS, 2018](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/manufacturingandproductionindustry/methodologies/ukmanufacturerssalesbyproductsurveyprodcomqmi)) and the omission of which will present a data gap, these values are estimated. In source data, these are notated as NA, N/A, S, S\*. To do so and following van Straalen *et al.* (2016), a ratio is calculated between units exported (generally not suppressed) and units produced for years for which data is available. Prodcom units are then estimated based on a calculation of export units \* ratio = prodcom units.
3.  Exports data to CSV format

##### Outputs

-   CSV of UK prodcom data across all available divisions (\< 33) in tidy format
-   CSV of domestic production data summarised by UNU in tidy format

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [003_total_inflows.R](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/electronics/003_total_inflows.R)

Script calculates total inflows based on the apparent consumption method (drawing on domestic production and trade data) and extracting placed on market data (PoM) from UK-level administrative data from the EEE/WEEE Extended Producer Responsibility Scheme. For the apparent consumption method, automated corrections are applied and forecasts generated by UNU to 2030 based on an ARIMA model with a central GDP forecast as external variable.

##### Apparent consumption method

<details>

<summary>More info: Apparent consumption</summary>

The most widely established methodological framework for measuring material resource flows at a national level is the Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounting (EW-MFA) system ([Eurostat, 2018](https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/ks-gq-18-006-en-n.pdf)) which also underpins the SNA SEEA Material Flow Accounts (SNA-SEEA-MFA) (Lysaght *et al.* 2022).

In the language of these statistical systems, in a closed economy or at the global level, the sum of domestic resource extraction (DE) is equivalent to consumption-based material flow indicators such as domestic material consumption (DMC) or raw material consumption (RMC) as well as their equivalent input-based indicators such as direct material input (DMI) and Raw Material Input (RMI) as all trade flows net out.

Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a headline indicator derived from the EW-MFA and SEEA-CF-MFA systems. It is currently the most widely used material flow-based indicator at the core of national statistical reporting on material flows. DMC is calculated by summing the used fraction of domestically extracted and harvested materials and the weight of imported raw materials, semi-finished and manufactured products, while excluding the weight of exported raw materials, semi-finished and manufactured products. DMC can therefore be written as:

$$DE + PtB$$

Where *DE* is domestic extraction and *PtB* defines the physical trade balance of *Im* i.e. imports and *Ex* i.e. exports. DMC excludes hidden flows throughout. A closely linked indicator, Direct Material Input (DMI) is based on the same methodology but incorporates the materials mobilised or used in the production of exported goods and services ([OECD, 2008](https://www.oecd.org/environment/indicators-modelling-outlooks/MFA-Guide.pdf)).

This methodology can be applied at a sub-national level too (albeit entirely within the confines of the technosphere) by summing domestic production and PtB, which is often referred to as an 'apparent consumption' method (e.g. Gray, 2021). A reliance on apparent consumption methodologies alone carry risk of obfuscating true global environmental impact of production and trade activities in the UK better captured through indicators such as 'raw material consumption' (RMC) and its equivalents. These seek to capture the full upstream used material extraction associated with consumption activities. At the same time, there remains a gap in the understanding of actual material flows through the UK economy and this work seeks to fill this gap.

</details>

###### Inputs

-   Prodcom data summarised by UNU (output of script 001)
-   Trade data summarised by UNU (output of script 002)
-   GDP forecasts

###### Workflow

1.  Import domestic production and trade data summarised by UNU
2.  **Apply outlier** detection algorithm using a rolling median absolute deviation (MAD, runmad package) and Hampel Filter algorithm (median +\_ 3 median absolute deviations) approach to aggregated domestic production, exports and imports data by UNU by year. Points deviating significantly from the trend are flagged for manual review. Point outliers for which out of sample behaviour cannot be explained are replaced based on a straight line interpolation between values for years either side of the outlier.
3.  Future baseline values for UNUs are **forecasted** using an ARIMA model to the year 2030, with an external economic variable - per capita GDP in chained volume measures (CVM). A chained volume measure of GVA and GDP is used to remove inflationary price effects, allowing for inter-temporal comparison in 'real' terms. While other variables such as household expenditure are likely to display a stronger relationship to apparent consumption of electronics, due to the availability of projections data for GDP as published by the UK OBR (alongside population by the ONS), GDP is used.
4.  Key indicators and aggregates are calculated for all years 1990-2030.
5.  Exports data to CSV format

###### Outputs

-   A CSV combining domestic production, import and export data, as well as the following derived indicators in unit terms:
    -   Total imports = sum of EU and non-EU source imports
    -   Total exports = sum of EU and non-EU source exports
    -   Net trade balance = Imports - exports i.e. PtB
    -   Apparent consumption = domestic_production + total imports - total exports
    -   Apparent output = domestic production + total exports
    -   Apparent input = domestic production + total imports

##### Placed on the market

###### Inputs

-   Environment Agency placed on market (POM) [data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee-in-the-uk) - Specific to producers who are obligated to report under the WEEE Directive. Separate studies e.g. those under the WEEE Flows series - Valpak ([UK EEEFlows 2018](https://sp.demeter.zeus.gsi.gov.uk/Sites/aa12/RDIA/ResourceEffic/Waste%2520Prevention%2520Programme/Chapter%25208%2520-%2520Electronics/Readings/1.%2520Overview/ukeeeflow2018updatereport-final_1.pdf?Web=1)), WRAP ([WRAP (2016)](http://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-electricals/esap/re-use-and-recycling/report/weee-market-flow-model-and-report) -- and separately, an [independent review](#0) (2020) by Anthesis, provide estimates of EEE onto the market trying to account for unregistered companies and those exempt from current regulations. Differences don't seem significant (all for the year 2017): EA official collection figures: 1,615k tonnes, Valpak: 1,821k tonnes, Anthesis: 1,657k tonnes.

###### Workflow

<summary>More info: Bill of materials</summary>

A BoM is a hierarchical data object providing a list of the raw materials, components and instructions required to construct, manufacture, or repair a product. BoMs are generally used by firms to communicate information about a product as it moves along a value chain in order to help navigate regulations, efficiently manage inventory and to support product life-cycle assessments. Utilising component and material shares captured within a BoM data object alongside corresponding information on the volume/mass of flows (and stocks) of products/components, makes it possible to move between material, component and product flows (and stocks) at the micro level. Some of the difficulties of accessing complete BoM data are described [here](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2020-07/CA_%20Prep%20Study_draft1_Feb2020.pdf) (pg. 177).

</details>

##### Workflow

1.  Extracts BoM data in either absolute or proportion terms (as available) from listed sources and assigns these to UNU-KEYs. Converts all BoM data to a proportional basis for use in sankey.
2.  Using mass data by UNU-KEY from Van Straalen *et al.* (2016) for its representativeness, (to be potentially updated with mass-based trade data in the medium-term followed by BoM based estimates coupled with product-market share data), multiplies this by inflow data to get total mass inflow by material/component for each UNU-KEY
3.  Exports data to CSV format

##### Outputs

-   Compiled BoM data in proportion terms
-   A CSV of annual inflows by UNU-KEY in mass terms

#### [005_stock_outflow_calculation.R](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/electronics/005_stock_outflow.R)

Script calculates values for the stock of electronics and outflows from the stock based on inflow data and lifespan assumptions

##### Inputs

-   Inflow data in unit and mass terms
-   Lifespan assumptions by UNU category transferred from life-time profiles in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Italy ([CIRCABC, 2023](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/636f928d-2669-41d3-83db-093e90ca93a2/library/8e36f907-0973-4bb3-8949-f2bf3efeb125/details)) and specified as scale and shape variables of a Weibull distribution

<details>

<summary>More info: Lifespans as an input into MFA</summary>

At its simplest, a lifespan refers to a specific interval of time an object exists in a particular form (see NICER overview). Here, 'lifetime seeks to capture the period after a product has been sold and stays in households or businesses until it is disposed of'. This includes 'the dormant time in sheds and the exchange of second-hand equipment between households and businesses within the country' ([CIRCABC, 2023](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/636f928d-2669-41d3-83db-093e90ca93a2/library/8e36f907-0973-4bb3-8949-f2bf3efeb125/details)).

Lifespan information can input into material stock and flow accounting, life-cycle costing and linked assessments of impact in various ways. For instance, material stock accounting can take a bottom-up approach based on item inventories and material intensities (e.g. Wiedenhofer *et al.* 2015), or be estimated from the top-down based on inflow data and estimated lifespan distributions as in delay/survival models (e.g. [Fishman *et al.* (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251510/).

As an example, the ONS and most National Statistical Institutions (NSIs) estimate the monetary value of non-financial assets as part of national balance sheets using a perpetual inventory method (PIM). This involves starting with a benchmark asset monetary value and accumulating asset purchases through gross fixed capital formation over their estimated lifetime (based on ad-hoc research e.g., [asset lives study](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/academic-review-asset-lives-uk)) via an assumed capital retirement distribution to estimate *gross* capital stocks. From this, a depreciation function is used to estimate the *net* capital stock (Dey-Chowdhury, 2009), with this further step taken because of the monetary representation of values.

</details>

##### Workflow

1.  Imports lifespan data specified as shape and scale parameters of the Weibull distribution - 'a continuous probability distribution that, when used for stock and flow models, can be described as modelling the population given a variable and time-dependent failure rate' ([ProSUM, 2017](https://www.prosumproject.eu/sites/default/files/170601%20ProSUM%20Deliverable%203.3%20Final.pdf)).
2.  Imports unit- and mass-level inflow data
3.  Estimates outflows by inflow year calculated based on a **hazard function** (h(y) (reflecting the probability that an event occurs in a period of time) and as the sum of discarded products entering the stock in each historic year multiplied by its lifetime distribution probability
4.  Calculate the stock in weight and units by calculating the cumulative sums of inflows and outflows by year and then subtracting from each other. Net change in stock between periods equals the difference between the total inflows and outflows i.e.

$$
K(t) = I(t)-O(t)
$$

where K(t) is the change and I(t) and O(t) are the corresponding inflows and outflows in that year, respectively. This net change is added to the stock level in year t-1

Stock estimates are compared against stock estimates data published by DESNZ (largely based on survey data), sources such as Ofcom and projections undertaken as part of the Market Transformation Programme.

5.  Combines inflow, stock and outflow by UNU-KEY by year into a single dataset
6.  Exports data to CSV format

##### Outputs

-   A CSV file containing inflow, stock and outflow data by UNU-Key by year in both unit and mass-terms

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [006_outflow_routing.R](https://github.com/OliverLysa/observatory/blob/main/scripts/electronics/006_outflow_routing.R)

2.  Maps GVA data for SIC codes 26-29 (capturing manufacturing-related GVA values) and codes representing repair andv maintenance activities (to capture structural shifts at the mes-level) to UNU-Keys
3.  Exports data to CSV format

<details>

<summary>More information: Intensity ratios</summary>

At its most basic, a measure of efficiency or productivity tells us about a relationship in terms of scale between an output and an input. Singular measures of resource efficiency/productivity (as opposite to combined measures e.g. total factor productivity) generally seek to track the effectiveness with which an economy or sub-national process uses resource inputs to generate material or service outputs or anthropocentric value of some description.

"Intensity indicators compare trends in economic activity such as value-added, income or consumption with trends in specific environmental flows such as emissions, energy and water use, and flows of waste. These indicators are expressed as either intensity or productivity ratios, where intensity indicators are calculated as the ratio of the environmental flow to the measure of economic activity, and productivity indicators are the inverse of this ratio." (SEEA-Environment Extensions, 2012, pg. 13).

Economic-physical productivity i.e. the money value of outputs per mass unit of material resource inputs. At national level, can be measured from production perspective (GDP/DMC or DMI), or can be measured from consumption perspective (GDP/RMC or RMI). Other indicators could be the amount of waste generated in relation to economic output, or alternatively in relation to resource inputs/stocks.

## Weaknesses and areas for improvement

1.  Several sources are updated sporadically or with no updates planned (e.g. generated through projects that have concluded)
2.  Mapping of compositional data to UNU isn't weighted by market share i.e. compositional data is not always representative
